    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> fresh orange and lemon juices, brown sugar, grated orange and lemon zests, and vanilla extract</li>
      <li><strong>The fruit you'll need:</strong> pineapple, strawberries, kiwis, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the sauce on the stove and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Arrange the fruits in a container, then pour the sauce over them.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
